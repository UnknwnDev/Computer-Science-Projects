1. Which one of these do you think is easier to implement and use, dynamic or static
polymorphism?
  
  Static Polymorphism is easier to implement because you are not required to make a 
  parent class with the things you want to call

2. Modern C++ development highly encourages static polymorphism over dynamic
polymorphism, why do you think that is?
  
  Like I said in the previous question it is easier and faster to implement and 
  this may improve the speed of which your program runs because it doesn't have
  to check the a parent class to override a function/variable.
